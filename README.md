These are 'raw' C++ programs made for assignments in my first and second year of the Game Programmer Futuregames Education in Boden (2023-2025).

Files where created in C:\Users\[USER NAME]\source\repos, as per Visual Studio defaults I believe.

If you're here to see my OpenGL game engine made during the Engine Specialization course, please visit the **_OGLEngine_** directory.

The TinyEngine stuff was for an earlier C++ course, where we were supplied an small engine to learn how to make a simple game with C++.
